# Beautiful Yapo.cl

This is a small chrome extension, to fix what I think are problems with yapo.cl ui.
Mostly because I got tired of how old-school and un-centered was yapo.cl's UI.

### What does it do:
- Centering the main content on every page.
- Moving/copying/cloning the ads around so you can position them better on the screen

### What is missing (AKA: Todo)
- Go Responsive :D
- Option to remove ads (?)
- Change icons/ui for sorting.
